# Thoughts about documentation and code comments

## Agenda

1. Talk a bit about documentation
2. Talk a bit about code comments

## Format

* Informal chat
* I have a few notes, but I'm hoping to uncover what thoughts and ideas each of
  us have, and where we agree and disagree
* Feel free to interrupt and ask questions at any time
