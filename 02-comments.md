# Comments

Loved and/or hated by any self-respecting developer...

"Code should be self-documenting! Therefore, any and all comments in code
reveal that the code itself is ðŸ’©"

"A developer that doesn't properly comment their code doesn't care about their
code, and the code is probably ðŸ’©"

... and the list goes on.

## How should we even start to discuss this topic?

* There are good reasons to add comments to code
* There are also good reasons to try to not add comments to code
* A piece of code can be obvious to you, but not to me and vice-versa
* A comment needs review like all other code
* A comment can become outdated (in Uncle Bob speak, I believe he says that
  comments "rot" quicker than code)
* Almost no matter how we frame it, it is a topic where *opinions* are many and
  varied

## Ok, let's maybe hear some opinions

* I think one reason is people can sometimes feel strongly about it one way or
  another, is simply that most people have seen comments that are badly
  written, explain the code incorrectly, or are woefully outdated
