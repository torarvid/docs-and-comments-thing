## What I end up doing for myself

* When I've written a piece of code and am about to make a PR, I skim through
  my diff, take a quick look at each line, and ask myself "will it make it
  easier for my reviewer if I add a comment to explain why this code is written
  as it is"?
* Remember that code is gonna be *read* much more often than it is gonna be
  *written*
* Try to unify my thinking of "should I refactor this" and "should I add a
  comment here"
