### My journey with a new employer/team/project re documentation

Well, same as above, with a few changes perhaps... History repeats itself.

* Whenever we start something, it will usually be small/non-existing at the
  time, and it's easy to think "well, this is just a small thing for now, no
  need for docs yet... We don't even know how it will work yet, so
  documentation would be obsolete before we even start!"
* And then we continue from around point 3. in the previous section ("People
  can just ask me how things work")

(Noticing while I'm writing this, that there are similarities to other aspects
of developer lyfe, like writing tests, working with observability, monitoring
etc)


README should invite more people to edit it!
