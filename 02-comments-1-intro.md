# Comments

Loved and/or hated by any self-respecting developer...

"A developer that doesn't properly comment their code doesn't care about their
code, and the code is probably ğŸ’©"

"Code should be self-documenting! Therefore, any and all comments in code
reveal that the code itself is ğŸ’©"

... and the list goes on, probably.
