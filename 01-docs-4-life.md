### My journey through life re documentation

1. I'm a developer, I want to write code, not documentation
2. I'm not a writer
3. People can just ask me how things work
4. Incidents happen and people don't understand how to fix
5. Ok, I'll write some notes
6. New people start and I spend way more time than I thought I would talking
   about how things work
7. I tell myself to get better at writing documentation in the future
