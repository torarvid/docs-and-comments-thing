### Can we get better at it?

* We could be more explicit about making documentation tasks when we're
  prioritizing work
  * This could include things like having a session with an outsider and get
    feedback on how well the documentation is understood
* We could talk more about it in an effort to engrain it into our culture as
  developers, but I have no idea whether that will work or not
* Maybe we need to accept that it will always be an area where people do "the
  least amount of work possible"
* We could attempt to formalize numbers that explain where we want the balance
  to be when it comes to writing/maintaining documentation vs other things. "We
  should use 5% of all of our time at work on documentation" or something like
  that (this would amount to around 2 hours per week)
* I do feel pretty good after having written a chunk of documentation... Maybe
  focus on that a bit more often...
