## How should we even start to discuss this topic?

* There are good reasons to add comments to code
* There are also good reasons to try to *not* add comments to code
* A piece of code can be obvious to you, but not to me and vice-versa
* A comment needs review like all other code
* A comment can become outdated (in Uncle Bob speak, I believe he says that
  comments "rot" quicker than code)
* Almost no matter how we frame it, it is a topic where *opinions* are many and
  varied
