## Ok, let's maybe hear some opinions

* I think one reason is people can sometimes feel strongly about comments one
  way or another, is simply that most people have seen comments that are badly
  written, explain the code incorrectly, woefully outdated, or all of the above
* Contrary to code, it's pretty hard to "compile" or "lint" comments, which
  make it hard to notice when you need to update them
* People sometimes add comments that explain *what* a piece of code does in
  such a way that it just "duplicates the code", instead of either *explaining*
  what it does or justify *why* a piece of code exists

Also, github PRs show diffs, and if there are comments outside of those diffs,
it's hard to see whether the comments need to be updated
