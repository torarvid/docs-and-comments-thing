### Why is it so hard to get good at this?

Mentioned some of these points in the "why do we document" section, but one way
to try to summarize could be "there's almost always something that feels
valuable to do that is also much more fun to do than documenting".

Counter-point: If you document something, you can outsource it the next time a boring job comes along
