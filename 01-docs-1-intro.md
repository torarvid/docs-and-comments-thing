# Documentation

## What's the scope of talking about documentation?

Well, we're a development team, so the purpose of this talk - documentation of
coding projects, and software/hardware that we use/run is what we're gonna talk
about.

There are different... "levels" in developer lyfe where it makes sense to talk
about documentation. You could for instance document:

* How we use coding conventions or do code reviews in the entire company
* A birds-eye view of what Alma is and how it works
* How trex interfaces with the SchÃ¤fer NGKP2 protocol
* What the AvisoClientException class is used for
* What the test_stripe_buffer unit test does

ðŸ¤” "Hey, wait a minute, you're suddenly talking about code comments now". Right
right, they are related, but let's start with focusing on documentation for
now...

We sometimes *write* documentation, and we sometimes *read* documentation.
