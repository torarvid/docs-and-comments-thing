 documentation

### Why do we document how our systems work?

* 👎 It takes time
* 👎 It's not clear what you're getting
* 👎 It's (usually) boring
* 👍 It makes it possible for others to understand how things work
* 👍 It decouples code authors from new starters
* 👍 You might leave the company some day (or you know, die in a freak accident
  etc)
