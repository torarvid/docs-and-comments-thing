## Ok, let's maybe hear some opinions

* I think one reason is people can sometimes feel strongly about comments one
  way or another, is simply that most people have seen comments that are badly
  written, explain the code incorrectly, woefully outdated, or all of the above
* Contrary to code, it's pretty hard to "compile" or "lint" comments, which
  make it hard to notice when you need to update them
* People often add comments that explain *what* a piece of code does, instead
  of justifying *why* a piece of code exists to solve (part of) a problem
