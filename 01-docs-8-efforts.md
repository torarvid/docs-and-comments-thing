### Where should we start spending our efforts?

Not sure, but how about some of these:

* Trex for dummies (how do you start out in our team? trex is a fairly
  specialized software suite that can feel intimidating to new developers)
* "Trex stories" or something
  * How a box goes from the boxing station to ending up on a pallet
  * What are vendor managers?
  * Adding a new HTTP endpoint and get it to work end-to-end with Alma
