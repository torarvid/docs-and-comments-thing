## Reading documentation

### What experiences do we have when wanting to consume documentation?

* 👎 It doesn't exist at all
* 👎 It's obsolete
* 👎 It's written by somebody who doesn't remember what it's like to not know
  anything about the project
* 😐 It gets you started, but not where you need to be
* 😐 Not all of it is obsolete, but you don't know which parts to trust and not
* 👍 It's clear and easy to understand (rare, but I guess it does happen)
